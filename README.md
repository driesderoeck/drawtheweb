Templates to collect drawings of the internet!
You are free to make your own drawings, or ask people around you to make a drawing of the internet. I found that asking children is suprisingly interesting to get new inspiration in many directions.
*Feel free to share your results!*

## about this project
I asked children between 6 and 12 to draw the internet to better understand how future generations think about the internet today.
To better understand what the internet is – and could be – I gave primary school children one simple instruction: “Draw the internet”. No rules, no judging – anything goes. One set of drawings was collected in a local European school in Belgium, and another set in a local African school in Senegal. This talk reports on the differences between both cultures as well as some overall observations.
